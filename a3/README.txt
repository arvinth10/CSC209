A hard link would only exist if two files reference the same inode. These files would be identical without having duplicate data on the system. It would be hard to detect hard links with our design since we are creating a new process for each directory. We would need to compare the inodes of all these directories to determine if there are hard links. Each process has its own memory space so this would be difficult to do this even with the use of pipes since we have incorporated recursive process calls.
